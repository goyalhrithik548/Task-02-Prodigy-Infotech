**Title:** Titanic Survival Analysis

Sample Dataset :- https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data

**Description:**
This repository contains an analysis of the Titanic dataset from Kaggle, focusing on exploring the relationships between various variables and identifying patterns and trends in the data. The analysis aims to understand the factors influencing survival outcomes during the Titanic disaster.

**Dataset:**
The dataset used for this analysis is the Titanic dataset from Kaggle, which contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including demographic details such as age, gender, passenger class, family size, and survival status.

**Analysis:**
The analysis includes data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of variables, identify missing values, and explore relationships between variables. Key findings include the following:

- Females within the age range of 0 to 18 years exhibited a higher survival rate.
- Passengers traveling with three family members showed a higher survival rate.
- Passengers belonging to Passenger Class 1 had a higher survival rate.

These insights underscore the importance of demographic factors such as age, gender, family size, and socio-economic status (Pclass) in influencing survival outcomes during the Titanic disaster.

**Conclusion:**
The analysis provides valuable insights into the factors that contributed to survival during the Titanic disaster. Understanding these dynamics can contribute to a deeper understanding of historical events and provide insights that may be applicable in contemporary contexts.
